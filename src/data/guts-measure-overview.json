In this task, participants will be asked to make four types of choices: 1) delay discounting choices for self, 2) control choices, 3) immediate giving choices, and 4) delay discounting choices for self versus others. The first type of choice includes decisions between a smaller, sooner reward for the self, and a larger, delayed reward for the self. The second type of choice includes decisions between a smaller and larger circle, and can be contrasted with delay discounting choices for self to obtain a general neural index of delay discounting decisions. The third type of choice includes decisions between self and other here and now (a single time-point so no comparison between now and later). The fourth type of choice includes decisions between self and others (specifically an unfamiliar peer and a friend), now and later. The amounts that participants can gain during trials will be between 2 and 10 euros. There will be 4 variations of immediate rewards (2, 4, 6 or 8 euros), and 5 variations of delays for delay discounting choices (0 days, 2 days, 4 days, 30 days, 90 days).",

In a congruent trial, all the arrows point in the same direction, whereas in the incongruent trial, the middle error is in the opposite direction. After a block, participants receive feedback (‘good job’, ‘be more accurate’, or ‘go faster’) to make sure that they make enough errors. In the Social Flanker task, this task is performed under two conditions: social and non-social. In the social condition, participants believe they receive feedback on their performance from a peer. In the non-social condition, the participant is not observed and receives feedback generated by a computer. The social flanker task will have a hyperscanning set-up, meaning the EEG activity of two participants will be recorded at the same time. At first, both participants will perform the task separately in different rooms. After a few runs, one of the participants will join the other participant in their room and will be seated slightly behind them while they perform the task. After the first participant finishes, they will switch positions and the second participant will perform the task while the first participant watches. Afterwards, both participants will return to their own rooms and \nanswer some questions on their experience with the tasks.",
