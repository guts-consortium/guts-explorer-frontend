During the game,children had to stay behind a line and could throw each ball only once.\nAfter the instructions,children practiced the game with the research assistant. After the practice session,the research assistant moved the line further away from the board until the distance was approximately three meters,making it practically impossible for children to get a ball on the board without cheating. ",
        "scoring": "Three undergraduate students were trained to code the videotapes on cheating behavior of the child together with a researcher, using a coding scheme based on Zwirs et al. (2015). There were three categories of cheating behavior 1) no cheating, 2) possible intention to cheat, and 3) cheating. Cheating behavior was defined as throwing a ball after reducing the distance to the board, throwing more than three balls, or sticking one or more balls directly on the board. Possible intention to cheat was scored when a child broke one of the rules of the game, but did not enhance his or her chance of winning more prices by doing so.",

You can then try to throw the balls onto this dart board. For every ball you manage to throw onto the board, you will receive an extra stamp! The game has two rules. The first rule is that need to throw the balls from this position (3m from the board) and you are not allowed to cross the line. The second rule is that you can throw each ball only once. If you've thrown the balls, you are not allowed to pick them up from the floor and throw again.[] I will check on your sibling, but while I'm gone you can play the game. ",

Within L-CID,the 11 items from the Effortful control subscale consisting of Attentional Control and Inhibitory Control are used. Additionally,within L-CID,items are alternated with Wildman questions.",
        "scoring": "Items are scored on a 5-point scale from 1 ('almost always untrue') to 5 ('almost always true'). The subscale scores can be calculated by summing the items and dividing the score by the number of items that were filled in, ignoring items with a 'does not apply' response and taking into account the items that should be reverse coded, i.e., items 2,4, and 5.",

Do not keep the cotton swab in one place in the mouth, but move it back and forth. The swab should remain in your child's mouth for 100 seconds. It is important that the end of the cotton ball is completely wet.\n\nUsing tube: Your child is supposed to swallow one last time. The saliva that then enters the mouth should be drained into the tube through the straw. To do this, your child holds his/her head slightly forward and the straw against the lower lip.The intention is that the tube is filled to the top of the serrated edge. This can take quite a while. Do not force it (then there will be a lot of bubbles in the tube), take your time, let the saliva flow into the tube calmly.",

We would like for you to use these word to create a story. You may use these words to make up a story. On this first card you see the title of the story and 3 rows of words. If you run down the rows of words from top to bottom you can discover the plot of the intended story. For example, the first card is about a trip to the park. The cards are meant to be a brief outline of the story. I would like to ask you to use the card as a starting point to tell the best possible story about <title card>. You don't have to use all the words if you don't want to and you can change the order of the words or the words themselves. The most important thing is that you come up with the best story you can tell. The length of each story should be about one page of written text, so please provide as much information and detail as you can think of. I will give you 2 minutes each time to look at the words and prepare a story. When you are ready to tell your story, you can tell me and start telling the story. If you don't completely know your storyline anymore, feel free to stop in between and take time to think. If you want to restart your story, that's no problem.

The parent and child must work together as one controls the left knob (draws only horizontal lines) and one controls the right knob (draws only vertical lines).

This is a device that looks like a watch that can register when your child is asleep or awake based on movement. Because we are interested in your children's sleeping patterns, the activity monitor only needs to be worn by your children at night.\n\nEvery evening the app indicates that the activity tracker needs to be attached to your children and every morning they can be put away again. You will be asked to put the activity tracker on your children for 4 nights. The first time will be the night before the first measurement day (for example, if you are taking measurements from Thursday to Sunday, you will be asked to put on the activity tracker for the first time on Wednesday evening, and for the last time on Saturday evening).\n\nPut on the activity tracker in the evening before going to sleep. It is best to put the activity tracker on 5 minutes before your children go to bed. The tracker is already fully set up. You don't need to turn it on before putting it on your kids.",

Prior to the lab visit, participants filled out a personal profile with questions about their favorite food or sports. During the lab visit, participants were told that unknown, same-aged peers had judged their profile and had provided feedback on whether they liked their profile (positive feedback), disliked their profile (negative feedback) or did not know whether they liked it or not (neutral feedback). Next, in the MRI scanner, participants were presented with pictures of these peers in either a green thumb up (positive feedback), a red thumb down (negative feedback) or a gray circle (neutral feedback). Following this feedback, participants had to imagine they could send a noise blast to the peer that judged them by pressing a button. The noise blast would increase in sound as they continued to press the button for a longer duration. Participants were instructed to always press the button, but to choose the duration of the button press themselves. The SNAT consisted of 60 trials: three blocks of 20 trials, with 20 trials in total for each feedback condition (positive, negative, and neutral). ",

Maybe they don't like [favorite food child] but they do like [ favorite sport child]. When you see the thumbs down, the child didn't like your profile. Maybe they don't like [favorite subject child] and [favorite movie child]. \n\n[sound gets played] How annoying did you find this sound?\n\n[During the practice round]: Oh, this child didn't like/liked/didn't know what to think about your profile. Now you get to decide how long you want them to listen to the sound. You have to press as quickly as possible as soon as you see the soundbar, and you only let go when the stripe on the bar reaches the volume/color you want the other child to listen to.\n\n[Before actual task:]  As soon as you see the noise screen, you have to press the 1 with your index finger.Always press as quickly as possible, you can choose how long you want to keep the button pressed.

So, the first rule of the game is that you have to touch the car as fast as you can. But there is another rule of the game. Sometimes a sign will show up next to the car [RA shows sign], that sign means: Stop [RA raises hand], you are not allowed to drive, so you cannot touch the car to make it drive away. This rule is very difficult, so it's okay if it doesn't go perfectly every time.

For each of the complaints below, please indicate to what extent you are or were bothered by it. \n\nEATQ: Below you can find 16 statements that people might use to describe their children/themselves.  For each statement, please indicate to what extent it is true for your child/you. There are no good or wrong answers. Please select the first answer that comes to you.\n\nCBQ/TMCQ: On the next pages you will find a set of statements that describe children's reactions to a number of situations. We would like you to tell us what your child's reaction is likely to be in those situations. There are of course no \"correct\" ways of reacting; children differ widely in their reactions, and it is these differences we are trying to learn about. Please read each statement and indicate to what extent the description applies to your child's reaction(s) within the past six months. If you cannot answer one of the items because you have never seen your child in that situation (for example, when you are asked how your child react when you sing but you never sing for them), then choose \"Never seen them in this situation\".\n\nPS/PAQ: At one time or another, all children misbehave or do things that could be harmful, are \u201cwrong,\u201d or that parents don\u2019t like. Examples include: hitting someone, forgetting homework, having a tantrum, whining, throwing food, lying, arguing back, not picking up things, refusing to go to bed, coming home late. Parents have many different ways or styles of dealing with these types of problems. Below are items that describe some styles of parenting. For each item, fill in the bubble that best describes your style of parenting during the past two months with your child.",
