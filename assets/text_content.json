Please explore the graphs below to get insight into the quality of these neuroimaging measures. All structural MRI scans underwent manual quality control using a standardized protocol (see Klapwijk et al. 2019). In addition, Qoala-T (Klapwijk et al. 2019), a supervised learning tool that asseses accuracy of manual quality control of T1 imaging scans and their automated neuroanatomical labeling processed in FreeSurfer, was run. Qoala-T scores provide an insight on scan quality (100 excellent to 0 poor). Below you will find the Qoala-T scores for each of the data waves and cohorts"
