        "descriptive_paragraph":"To better understand the longitudinal developmental pathways of social competence and behavioral control, the Leiden-CID study has a unique study design. Each cohort has six annual measures, and across the 6 waves home and lab visits are alternated. This allows us to study longitudinal within-person development of social competence on a behavioral and neural level. The last two waves of the ECC overlap with the first two waves of the MCC, resulting in a cohort-sequential design including children aged 3-14 years old. The overlap between the two cohorts not only allows for modeling development over a 10 year period, but also allows us to replicate our findings. Additionally, to experimentally examine social enrichment, we included a parenting intervention, which allows us to investigate causal effects of parenting on social development. Between the 2nd and 3rd measurement, 40% of the sample received a video feedback intervention to promote positive parenting and sensitive discipline (VIPP-SD). Below you can find an overview of this design. Please hover over the data type icons on the bottom of the overview page to see the relevant waves highlighted."

Please explore the graphs below to get insight into the quality of these neuroimaging measures. All structural MRI scans underwent manual quality control using a standardized protocol (see Klapwijk et al. 2019). In addition, Qoala-T (Klapwijk et al. 2019), a supervised learning tool that asseses accuracy of manual quality control of T1 imaging scans and their automated neuroanatomical labeling processed in FreeSurfer, was run. Qoala-T scores provide an insight on scan quality (100 excellent to 0 poor). Below you will find the Qoala-T scores for each of the data waves and cohorts."
